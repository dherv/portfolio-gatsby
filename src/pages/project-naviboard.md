Japan Railway, who is our end client, presented the project during a tech event last November. The system is composed of an admin website, an IOS application, and a display website. On the admin website, a user will configure maps, destinations, and the paths to those destinations. On the iPhone, after selecting a destination, each user gets a personal icon so they can be directed by looking at displays installed throughout the place instead of their phone. The system uses beacon technology to calculate a smartphone's position and the IOS application communicates with the display through WebSockets.
