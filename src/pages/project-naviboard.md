The project was presented during a tech event last November. The system is composed of an admin website, an IOS application, and a display website. On the admin website, you can configure maps, destinations, and the paths to those destinations. On the iPhone, after selecting your destination, you receive a personal icon and get directed to your destination by looking at the displays installed throughout the place, instead of your phone. The system uses beacon technology to calculate a smartphone's position and the IOS application communicates with the display through WebSockets.
