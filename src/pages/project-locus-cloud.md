Locus Cloud is a reporting website that aims to help manage the data provided by the RFID technology (scan items codes in stores). The system displays articles that have been scanned, the stocks, the shipments, the arrivals, and the inventories. Inside the settings page, an admin user can configure the whole system and manage how the data will be displayed.
