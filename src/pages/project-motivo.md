Motivo CRM is a recruiting system application, composed of three websites: candidate, recruiter, company. As a candidate you can create multiple profiles, connect with recruiters, look at job offers, apply to one, manage your tasks within a kanban board (like Trello), respond to invitations, and also create events on a calendar or chat with people and send emails. Recruiters and companies have access to the same technology with some personalized features.
